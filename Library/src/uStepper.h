/**
*	\mainpage Arduino library for the uStepper Board
*	
*	This is the uStepper Arduino library, providing software functions for the different features of the uStepper board.
*	
*	\par Features
*	The uStepper library contains the following features:
*	
*	- Second order acceleration profile, to provide smooth ramping of the speed and to avoid the motor stalling when demanding high speeds.
*	- Temperature measurement of the stepper driver chip by means of a NTC resistor placed beneath the chip.
*	- Measure the current position of the shaft (absolute, multiple revolutions)
*	- Measure the current speed of the motor 
*	
*	The library uses both timer one and timer two in order to function properly, meaning that unless the user of this library
*	can accept the loss of some functionality, these two timers are unavailable and the registers associated with these timers
*	should not be reconfigured.
*
*	Timer one is used for sampling the encoder in order to provide the ability to keep track of both the current speed and the
*	angle moved since the board was reset (or a new home position was configured). 
*	
*	Timer two is used to calculate the stepper acceleration algorithm.  
*	\warning In order to get some features working, it was necessary to write functions to control the I2C hardware in the MCU, since 
*	the build in wire library of Arduino uses interrupt which doesn't play well when used inside a timer interrupt routine. Therefore if
*	the user of this library needs to use the I2C bus, the user should use the functions defined in this library instead of wire library !
* 
*	\par Installation
*	To install the uStepper library into the Arduino IDE, perform the following steps:
*
*	- Download uStepper.zip
*	- Open the Arduino IDE
*	- Select sketch from the top menu
*	- Select include library
*	- Select add .ZIP library
*	- Navigate to where you downloaded uStepper.zip to and select
*	- The library contains support for driving the stepper, measuring temperature and reading out encoder data. Two examples are included to show the functionality of the library. 
*	
*	The library is tested with Arduino IDE 1.6.8
*	
*	\par Theory
*
*	The acceleration profile implemented in this library is a second order profile, meaning that the stepper will accelerate with a constant acceleration, the velocity will follow
*	a linear function and the position will look like an S-curve (it will follow a linear function at top speed and a second order function during acceleration and deceleration).
*	As a result, the position of the stepper motor will have continous and differentiable first and second derivatives.
*
*	The second order acceleration profile can be illustrated as follows (<a rel="license" href="http://picprog.strongedge.net/step_prof/step-profile.html">Source</a>):

*
*	\image html dva.gif
*
*	From the above picture it can be seen how the motor moves with this second order acceleration profile. The postion is depicted as orange, velocity as red and the acceleration as green.	
*
*	The algorithm used is NOT designed by me, I ONLY implemented the algorithm! credit is therefore given to the appropriate author: Aryeh Eiderman.	
*
*	for those interested, the deriviation of the algorithm used can be found at the following webpage (Which is neither owned nor affiliated with ON Development IVS in any
*	way): <a rel="license" href="http://hwml.com/LeibRamp.pdf">Real Time Stepper Motor Linear Ramping Just by Addition and Multiplication</a>

*
*	\par To do list
*	- Fix bug in stepper algorithm
*	- Clean out in unused variables
*	- Update comments
*	- Implement multiaxis feature between multiple uSteppers
*	- Add support for limit switches
*
*	\par Known Bugs
*	\bug Stepper algorithm still has a bug, which makes the deceleration part perform strange under a small subset of max velocity/acceleration settings. This bug is due to lack of precision
*	in the variables used for the algorithm, and will be fixed in a later version. However, the subset of settings is small, and therefore other tasks has been prioritized.
*
*	\author Thomas Hørring Olsen (thomas@ustepper.com)
*	\par Change Log
*	\version 0.3.0:
*	- Added support for speed readout
*	- Added support for measuring the shaft position with respect to a zero reference. (absolute within multiple revolutions)
*	\version 0.2.0:
*	- Complete rewrite of the stepper algorithm in assembler
*	- Changed from fixed point to floating point variables, due to the need for more precision
*	- Removed the getSpeed() method, as it didn't work, and therefore it would make more sense to remove it
*	  and re-add it when i get the time to fix it
*	- Added a few doxygen comments
*	- Added a new method (getStepsSinceReset()), which returns all steps performed since reset of the uStepper.
*	  positive values corresponds to steps in clockwise direction, while negative values corresponds to steps
*	  in counterclockwise direction.	
*	\version 0.1.0:	
*	- Initial release

*	This class is needed in this library, as arduino's build in "wire" library uses interrupts to access the TWI interface, and since the uStepper
*	library needs to use the TWI interface within a timer interrupt, this library cannot be used. As a result of this, the "wire" library, cannot
*	be used in sketches using the uStepper library, as this will screw with the setups, and make the sketch hang in the timer interrupt routine.
*	Instead, if the programmer of the sketch needs to interface with external I2C devices, this class should be used. This library contains a
*	predefined object called "I2C", which should be used for these purposes.
*
*	The functions "read()" and "write()", should be the only functions needed by most users of this library !
